# Content-Security-Term

Content security systems provide fine-grained control and security on particular network applications. Examples of Cisco content security products include the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

The Cisco ESA is a type of firewall and threat monitoring appliance for SMTP traffic that offers the following:

1. The capability to quickly block new email-based blended attacks

2. The capability to control or encrypt sensitive outbound email

3. A rapid spam capture rate and few false positives

4. A proven zero-hour antivirus solution

Similar to how the Cisco ESA protects email traffic, the Cisco WSA provides secure web access, content security, and threat mitigation for web services. In addition to helping to secure and control web traffic, the Cisco WSA provides the following forms of protection:

1. Advanced malware protection

2. Application Visibility and Control

3. Insightful reporting

4. Secure mobility
